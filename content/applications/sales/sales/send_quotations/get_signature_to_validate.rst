Online signatures for order confirmations
=========================================

The Odoo *Sales* application provides customers with the ability to confirm orders, via an online
signature, directly on the sales order. Once the sales order is electronically signed by the
customer, the salesperson attached to the sales order is instantly notified that the order is
confirmed.

Activate online signatures
==========================

In order to have customers confirm orders with an online signature, the *Online Signature* **must**
be activated.

To activate the *Online Signature* feature, go to :menuselection:`Sales app --> Configuration -->
Settings`, scroll to the :guilabel:`Quotations & Orders` heading, and activate the :guilabel:`Online
Signature` feature by checking the box beside it.

Then, click the :guilabel:`Save` button in the top-left corner.

.. note::
   When making a quotation template, this option is the :guilabel:`Signature` feature option,
   located in the :guilabel:`Online confirmation` field of the quotation template form.

   On standard quotations, this option is the :guilabel:`Signature` feature, located under the
   :guilabel:`Other Info` tab of the quotation form.

Order confirmations with online signatures
==========================================

When clients access quotations in their customer portal, there's a :guilabel:`Sign & Pay` button
directly on the quotation.

When clicked, a :guilabel:`Validate Order` pop-up window appears. In this pop-up window, the
:guilabel:`Full Name` field is auto-populated, based on the contact information in the database.

Then, customers have the option to enter an online signature with any of the following options:
:guilabel:`Auto`, :guilabel:`Draw`, or :guilabel:`Load`.

:guilabel:`Auto` lets Odoo automatically generate an online signature based on the information in
the :guilabel:`Full Name` field. :guilabel:`Draw` lets the customer use the cursor to create a
custom signature directly on the pop-up window. And :guilabel:`Load` lets the customer upload a
previously-created signature file from their computer.

When they have chosen any of the three previously mentioned signature options (:guilabel:`Auto`,
:guilabel:`Draw`, or :guilabel:`Load`), they will click the :guilabel:`Accept & Sign` button.

When :guilabel:`Accept & Sign` is clicked, the various payment method options become available for
them to choose from.

Then, when the quotation is paid and confirmed, a delivery order is automatically created (if the
Odoo *Inventory* app is installed).
